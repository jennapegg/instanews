# Instanews

This site is a creation by RED Academy to show students proficiency in SASS, GULP, and API's. This site is based off of the New York Times' top news stories, and features an on change function to access the appropriate stories when the different categories are selected. It is also a responsive site, styled mobile first.

    <li>GULP</li>
    <li>New York Times API JSON file</li>
    <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
</ul>

# Reflections 

This site helped to give me a better understanding of API's, and helped me learn how to used API keys, as was neccessary for the New York Times one. It also helped me to better understand SASS, as well as the use of partials in styling. I was also able to gain more understanding of SASS mixins, media queries, and variables.

# Installation

To get started, you first have to request an API key from the New York Times developer site. Simply go to https://developer.nytimes.com/ and request a key using your email. From there, input the key into the top stories portion of the site to get the JSON files.
