# Instanews

Instanews is a website built to showcase my abilities with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. This site includes an API from the New York Times, and displays the top articles in the appropriate sections using a change function. It is a responsive and mobile first application, so it is initially coded for mobile use and then adjusted to tablet and desktop views.

# Getting Started

To use this program, you first have to get an API key from the New York Times developer site. Simply go to https://developer.nytimes.com/ and request a key using your email. From there, input the key into the top stories portion of the site to get the JSON files. Any code editor will work with this program. A standard editor was used, and cdnâ€™s were used in place of downloads.

# Code Style

This site was coded with standard HTML, CSS, Jquery, Ajax, and Javascript. I primarily used flexbox to place the items correctly, as well as relative and absolute positions for the news articles themselves. I used .ajax for the change event and placed the articles into an empty div in my HTML, making use of the API.
